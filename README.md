# EmojifyHave you ever wanted to make your text messages more expressive? Our emojifier app will help you do that. So rather than writing "Congratulations on the promotion! Lets get coffee and talk. Love you!" the emojifier can automatically turn this into "Congratulations on the promotion! üëç Lets get coffee and talk. ‚òïÔ∏è Love you! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
So what we gonna do we will build two models one using Simple Rnn and another with LSTM and pretrained Glove Word Embedding using word vectors, we will see that even if your training set explicitly relates only a few words to a particular emoji, our algorithm will be able to generalize and associate words in the test set to the same emoji even if those words don't even appear in the training set. This allows you to build an accurate classifier mapping from sentences to emojis, even using a small training set.
